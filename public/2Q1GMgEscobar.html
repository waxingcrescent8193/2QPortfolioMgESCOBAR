    <p> "Education is important, and comprehension is key", is what we believe here in Schoogle. Many students now struggle with their 
        lessons, especially in subjects like Math. We aim to make education more understandable for students of all ages. However, 
        we cannot do that all alone. We need the manpower of tutors, and the support of students. </p>
    
    <p> Learning can be made easy, and this is where we come in. Our organization aims to create learning environments that blends 
        different learning styles and techinques, wherein every student can find a tutor that's just right for them. In pursuit of 
        this goal, our tutors are of different educational backgrounds. </p>

    <p> Schoogle tutors are one of the best, with many of them leading experts in their respective fields. However, skill is not 
        the only thing that makes a great educator, there is also passion. If you believe that you have the skills or the passion 
        to educate, join us! The world needs more people like you. </p>
